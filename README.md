# Letter Potato ðŸ¥”
Make the longest word you can with a limited set a letters!

## [**Start playing here!**](https://letter-potato.ryanmcgill.io/)
## Gameplay
Your goal is to create the longest, valid English word you know when you only
have eight letters to use. Letters can be repeated; this isn't a newspaper
Jumble! The only thing you can't do is use letters that aren't in that set of
eight.

Letter Potato is played on your own time! Hop into a game room, find as many
words as you can think of, then come back later and see if you're still at the
top of the leaderboard.

### Room Codes
Any four-letter code will get you into a game. If you're the first person to
create a room, you'll start with a new set of eight letters and no discovered
words. If you enter a room code that someone else used before, you'll join a
game with an existing set of letters plus any words found by other players.

## This game is a Work In Progress!
This game isn't finished yet! Here are the major things under development:
* Remembering a player's name between recent refreshes
* Allowing name and room changes from the game screen
* Showing room suggestions underneath the room code entry screen
* Various development chores
    * Adding documentation
    * Adding Jest unit tests
    * Cleaning up CSS
